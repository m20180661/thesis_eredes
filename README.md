## üß≠ Project Overview

This thesis proposes a dimensional data warehouse architecture for analyzing open energy datasets provided by **E-REDES**, the Portuguese electricity distribution operator. Using the **Medallion architecture** (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold) in **Microsoft Fabric**, the solution enables analytical insights on consumption patterns, electric mobility infrastructure, renewable energy deployment, and service reliability across Portugal.

The architecture follows the **Kimball methodology**, supporting incremental builds, reusable conformed dimensions, and Power BI reporting.

## üß± Modeled Tables

### üìä Fact Tables
| Table                          | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `fact_energyconsumption_hourly`    | Hourly consumption per grid zone (zipcode level) |
| `fact_energyconsumption_municipality` | Daily/monthly aggregated consumption by municipality |
| `fact_energyconsumption_zipcode`     | Daily aggregated consumption by postal code |
| `fact_electricmobility`              | Infrastructure metrics for EV chargers per municipality |
| `fact_serviceinterruptions`         | SAIDI, SAIFI and reliability metrics per year and municipality |
| `fact_energyproduction`             | Daily renewable energy injected into the grid |
| `fact_evimpact`                     | Estimated EV impact on grid load (composite indicators) |
| `fact_loadbalance`                  | Net consumption vs. production per area |
| `fact_serviceorders`                | Monthly breakdown of service orders and grid interventions |
| `fact_gridoperations`              | Operational metrics related to switching, outages, etc. |
| `fact_renewableadoption`           | Adoption of renewable production units per tech/type |
| `fact_renewablegoals`              | Long-term policy targets by region and technology |

### üß≠ Dimension Tables
| Table            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `dim_date`           | Calendar reference with full hierarchy (day/month/year/quarter) |
| `dim_municipality`   | Geographic reference by municipality, with area and location data |
| `dim_parish`         | Sub-municipality level (freguesia) for fine-grained analysis |
| `dim_zipcode`        | Zipcode-based reference for high-resolution consumption mapping |
| `dim_servicetype`    | Classification of electricity services (e.g., HT, MT, LT) |
| `dim_technology`     | Renewable energy technologies (e.g., wind, solar) |
| `dim_policy`         | Energy policy framework, targets, and implementation metadata |

> All surrogate keys (SKs) are generated using SHA-256 hashing on standardized name combinations, ensuring uniqueness and enabling conformed joins across fact and dimension tables.
